## Assembly

1: Solder the 5 pin header & usb-c port to the pcb

2: Desolder the 5 pin header on the 360 controllers

3: solder the other side of the 5 pins on the pcb to the board (You might have to bend the pins slightly to line up the port)

4: install the 3d printed bracket

5: screw the controller back together

**Changelog:**

**1.4:**

- Replaced the usb c receptacle with TYPE-C-31-M-12, this may require some additional modification of the 3d printed bezel, but should make the adapters last way longer.
